    <h1>Cybercrime</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
    <h2>Not to be confused with virtual crime.</h2>
    <p>Cybercrime encompasses a wide range of criminal activities that are carried out using digital devices and/or
        networks. These crimes involve the use of technology to commit fraud, identity theft, data breaches, computer
        viruses, scams, and expanded upon in other malicious acts. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in computer
        systems and networks to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information, disrupt services, and cause
        financial or reputational harm to individuals, organizations, and governments.[1]</p>
    <p>In 2000, the tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders placed cyber
        crimes into five categories: unauthorized access, damage to computer data or programs, sabotage to hinder the
        functioning of a computer system or network, unauthorized interception of data within a system or network, and
        computer espionage.[1]</p>
